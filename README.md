# Murph - Python Framework for Fast GRPC Services

Murph is a powerful Python framework that allows you to create high-performance GRPC services without the need for predefined Protobuf files. With Murph, you can write your services and messages in Python, and the framework will automatically generate the Protobuf files for you, saving you time and effort.

The defining feature of Murph is its Django-like models, which allow you to define your messages in a clear and concise manner. This makes it easy to work with complex data models and ensures that your code is both easy to read and maintain.

By using Murph's core feature of automatic Protobuf file generation, you can significantly cut down your development time and focus on your Python code instead. With Murph, you don't have to worry about dealing with other GRPC components, such as compiled clients, messages, and other boilerplate code. This makes it easier to get started with GRPC development and reduces the amount of time you spend on setup and configuration. By simplifying the development process, Murph allows you to focus on what really matters - building fast, efficient GRPC services. With Murph, you can write your services and messages in Python and let the framework handle the rest, saving you valuable time and effort.

Although Murph is in an early stage of development, more features will come to the framework soon. We encourage developers to contribute to the public repository and help us make Murph an even more powerful and flexible framework.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, Murph is the perfect choice for building fast, reliable GRPC services in Python. Experience the power and flexibility of Murph for yourself today.
